# Note:

*11/14/25 7:33 PM: Ethan, I just put in my updates (on the main file and the Note class) into a seperate folder under src titled "MusikhelferMo" for you to consolidate. I've added update comments/indicators in the code to make it easier for you to find the changes. :)

*11/13/25 9:20 PM: I'm pretty sure that some was Simon's work was accidentally deleted, or rather, replaced by Mo when uploading his files to the MusikHelfer folder, so just as a reminder, remember add all of your code as a seperate folder into the github when updating like Kai did today:*

*I will assimilate everything later. - Ethan Tang*

*11/7/25: Whenever saving code to here, simply upload the pde files into this file, I will assimilate everything into the three pde files in the MusikHelfer folder later and then delete the assimilated pde files. Its also a good idea to add all of the code in the MusikHelfer folder into your personal pde files on your computers periodically to stay up to date with any changes -Ethan Tang*

## File Assimilation Record

12/2/25: 9:57 AM: Kai's updates assimilated. 

11/25/25: 9:57 AM: Kai's and Mo's updates assimilated 

11/14/25: 8:28 PM: All group member updates assimilated.

11/13/25: 9:42 PM: All of my, Mo's, Simon's and Kai's work has been assimilated into one folder, the note input functions, and the methods tunerMode and harmonize are still unfinished. Also, Aristotle, I saw that you added updates for the metronome, but deleted them later-its fine to upload unfinished work, I can just comment it out when assimilating if said unifinished work prevents the program from running, like what I did with Kai's code today. -Ethan Tang

11/9/25: 5:31 PM: MusikHelfer and Note have both assimilated new updates and have been adjusted for the UI display. -Ethan Tang

11/7/25: 10:53 AM: Both pde files Music App and Note have been assimilated into the MusikHelfer folder and deleted. -Ethan Tang
